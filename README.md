# Open Healthcare Management System (OHMS)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Open Healthcare Management System (OHMS)! This system aims to revolutionize healthcare management for small and medium-sized medical enterprises and practitioners. By providing innovative solutions to traditional inefficiencies, OHMS strives to streamline operations, enhance patient-provider interactions, and elevate the quality of care delivery.

## Background of the Project

OHMS emerged in response to the challenges faced by SME medical centers and individual practitioners. Traditional healthcare appointment systems and management solutions often suffer from inefficiencies that hinder effective patient care. OHMS is designed to address these challenges and provide a comprehensive solution that meets the unique needs of SME medical centers and practitioners.

## Objectives and Scope

The primary objective of OHMS is to develop a secure, streamlined Healthcare Membership Management System (HMMS) tailored explicitly for SME medical centers and practitioners. By improving patient engagement, healthcare provider efficiency, and overall healthcare outcomes, OHMS aims to enhance the quality of care delivery. The scope of OHMS includes intuitive appointment scheduling, robust patient data management, clear medication communication, and fostering a patient-centric approach to healthcare delivery.

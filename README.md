# Open Healthcare Management System (OHMS)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Open Healthcare Management System (OHMS)! This system aims to revolutionize healthcare management for small and medium-sized medical enterprises and practitioners. By providing innovative solutions to traditional inefficiencies, OHMS strives to streamline operations, enhance patient-provider interactions, and elevate the quality of care delivery.

## Background of the Project

OHMS emerged in response to the challenges faced by SME medical centers and individual practitioners. Traditional healthcare appointment systems and management solutions often suffer from inefficiencies that hinder effective patient care. OHMS is designed to address these challenges and provide a comprehensive solution tailored to the unique needs of SME medical centers and independent practitioners.

## Objectives and Scope

OHMS focuses on improving patient engagement, increasing healthcare provider efficiency, and elevating overall healthcare outcomes. Key features include:

- Robust patient data management  
- Clear medication and treatment communication  
- A patient-centric approach to care delivery
